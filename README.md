# Instagram_message
<h4>Using Selenium WebDriver, we automate Sending the same message to numerous people given by the user.</h4>  
<br> 
We use the Selenium webdriver module to open the Instagram login page which is filled automatically with the username and password provided by the user. The webdriver then searches for the people in the given list and one by one sends the provided message to every one of them.
<br>
After sending all the messages as instructed, it closes the web browser and thus ends the program.
